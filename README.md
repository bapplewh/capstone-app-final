# capstone-app-final

This is my compeleted, final project for a personal training website. It is mobile responsive and includes a admin dashboard for the website owner to use to store client information. I used Python and Django to implement the backend functionality including the sign in/sign out authentication. SQLite is used to implement the tables that are used in the admin dashboard. There is also CRUD functionality that is integrated to allow the admin to create clients, view/edit clients, delete clients, create orders, and edit orders. The admin can also change the status of the client to active or inactive.

On the sign up page, the form is connected to an API that will send an external backend dashboard (FormSpree) any inquiries; those inquiries will also be sent to the given email address, so the website owner will get an email notification when there is a client lead.
